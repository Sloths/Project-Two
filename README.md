# Project Two - Virtual Robot Treasure Hunt

The task we decided to implement was the Level 3 scenario. The scenario's requirements were to set up a number of landmarks, a set of traffic lights with instructions and a number of treasures. The two robots, each with a random starting point should collect different treasures that are worth at least 100 points before reaching their given landmark, whilst avoiding each other, moving away from the landmarks with no treasures and following the traffic light instructions. This process occurs until one of the robots has found its treasure first. Furthermore the information about the landmark should be displayed on the screen, as the robot approaches the landmark. 

In our interpretation of the specification we decided to have 4 treasures which would randomly spawn at different landmarks. The robots would randomly spawn and move towards the treasure. If the robot was in a green light zone it would continue, in an amber light zone it would slow down and in a red light zone it would stop. The four light zones change every 3 seconds until both robots have found their two treasures. The robot would only find the treasure by having its x and y coordinates match the landmark where the treasure was located. Once the treasure was found, the treasure would be cleared and the landmark would turn from green to amber indicating that it had been visited by one of the robots. The robots would continue to find treasure until it had found two treasures, and then the robotâ€™s timer would stop. The main program timer would only stop when both robots have found their two treasures.
